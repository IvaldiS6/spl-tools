# nft-airdrop
Simple python script to airdrop nfts.

Add a list of token addresses held by your signing wallet in [tokens.txt](https://github.com/triiq/nft-airdrop/blob/main/tokens.txt).
Add a list of wallet addresses in [wallets.txt](https://github.com/triiq/nft-airdrop/blob/main/wallets.txt).

If this was useful, come say hey on twitter [**@triiq**](https://twitter.com/triiq_) or leave me a tip triiq.sol :)

### How I Use It
I use a combination of a custom rpc node and multiple instances of this script to send hundresds of tokens quickly.
